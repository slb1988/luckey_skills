  TeamCity server administration toolkit — manage service lifecycle, inspect/edit configuration,
  set up LDAP/authentication, verify runtime health, troubleshoot issues, and operate the REST API.
  Use when the user mentions TeamCity, teamcity, TC server, teamcity-server,
  "restart TeamCity", "check TeamCity logs", "TeamCity config", "LDAP TeamCity",
  "TeamCity agent", "build agent", "teamcity data directory", "build chain", "build queue",
  "no compatible agents", "reverse.dep", "snapshot dependency", or any TeamCity
  admin/ops/API task. Also trigger when the user reports problems with the TeamCity
  web UI, login, builds, or agent assignment on this host.
compatibility: linux, bash, ps, grep, find, curl

# TeamCity Administration Skill

This skill knows how to operate and troubleshoot TeamCity installations across multiple machines. It uses a host fingerprint system to identify which machine it's running on and loads the appropriate configuration reference.

## Step 0 — Identify the machine

Before doing anything else, determine which host you're on:

```bash
hostname
```

Then read `references/host-fingerprint.md` and match the output to the correct section. This prevents operating on the wrong machine when this skill is deployed to multiple servers.

If the hostname is not found in the fingerprint file, treat it as an unknown machine and discover TeamCity:
```bash
find / -name "teamcity-server.sh" 2>/dev/null
find / -name "teamcity-startup.properties" 2>/dev/null
```

Then read the startup properties to find the data directory (`teamcity.data.path`). Use what you discover — don't assume `/data/TeamCity` is the install or data path.

## Reference files

After identifying the machine, read the corresponding reference file:

| Machine | Reference file |
|---|---|
| `auto-server` | `references/auto-server.md` |

Always read the reference file before acting — it contains the actual paths, ports, and credentials for that specific machine. Do not hardcode paths from the fingerprint table; the reference file is the source of truth.

| Topic | Reference file |
|---|---|
| LDAP setup / auth | `references/ldap-config.md` |
| REST API (queries, parameters, queue) | `references/rest-api.md` |
| Build chain & parameter passing lessons | `references/build-chain-lessons.md` |
| Agent pinning and `reverse.dep.*` behavior | `references/agent-pinning.md` |
| Non-obvious traps and gotchas | `references/gotchas.md` |

Read the relevant reference before acting on that topic.

## Common workflows

### Service management

Always use `runAll.sh` (from the installation `bin/` directory) to start/stop, as it handles both server and agent:

```bash
# Stop
cd <install-dir> && bash bin/runAll.sh stop

# Start (background)
cd <install-dir> && nohup bash bin/runAll.sh start > /tmp/teamcity-startup.log 2>&1 &
```

Verify with `ps aux | grep -E "teamcity|TeamCity" | grep -v grep`. Expect at least the restarter, server JVM, and agent JVM processes.

### Config inspection

All runtime config lives under `<data-dir>/config/`. The data directory is NOT necessarily the same as the install directory — always check `teamcity-startup.properties` for `teamcity.data.path`.

Key files:
- `main-config.xml` — server identity (UUID, root URL)
- `database.properties` — database connection
- `ldap-config.properties` — LDAP integration
- `auth-config.xml` — authentication module registration
- `_auth/` directory — individual auth module XMLs

### LDAP activation

If `ldap-config.properties` does not exist in `<data-dir>/config/`, LDAP login is inactive even though the `ldap` plugin loads. See `references/ldap-config.md` for the full guide.

Quick start:
```bash
cp <data-dir>/config/ldap-config.properties.dist <data-dir>/config/ldap-config.properties
```

TeamCity picks up changes to this file automatically — restart is only needed if the file didn't exist before.

### Log inspection

Primary log location: `<data-dir>/logs/teamcity-server.log`
Secondary (may be symlinked): `<install-dir>/logs/teamcity-server.log`

Search patterns:
```bash
grep -i "ldap\|error\|exception\|warning" <log-file> | tail -50
grep -i "plugin" <log-file> | grep -i "load\|init\|fail"
```

### Agent management

Agent config: `<data-dir-adjacent>/buildAgent/conf/buildAgent.properties`
Check `serverUrl` is correct and agent is connected.

## Important principles

- **Data dir ≠ install dir.** This is the most common pitfall. Always read `teamcity-startup.properties` to find the real config location.
- **The .dist files are templates.** They get overwritten on restart. Always copy to the non-dist version to make changes permanent.
- **Check hostname first.** When this skill is used on multiple machines, the first thing to verify is which machine you're on.
- **Use nohup for starts.** TeamCity server takes time to initialize. Don't block the terminal.
